# Living Theory of Change (LTOC) Platform

A collaborative knowledge creation system that enables systems change practitioners, researchers, and stakeholders to collectively develop, synthesize, and apply theoretical frameworks for social transformation.

## Overview

The Living Theory of Change platform visualizes knowledge as a living organism that grows and evolves through community contributions. It combines individual expertise with collective intelligence through AI-enhanced collaboration.

## Documentation

- **[Product Requirements Document](docs/living_theory_prd.md)** - Comprehensive product vision, features, and roadmap
- **[Technical Implementation Companion](docs/living_theory_technical_companion.md)** - Test-driven development framework with systems architecture

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Knowledge Creation** - Real-time collaborative editing with attribution tracking
- **AI-Powered Synthesis** - Intelligent content synthesis across contributions
- **Peer Review System** - Structured review and consensus building
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Knowledge represented as a living, evolving organism
- **Multi-Stakeholder Tools** - Tailored resources for practitioners, researchers, and implementers

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API with pgvector
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **UI**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS

## Development Approach

This project follows a test-driven development approach with:
- User stories as the foundation for all features
- 80% test pass threshold for progression
- Modular architecture with clear input/output contracts
- Real data usage after Supabase integration
- AI self-testing capabilities
