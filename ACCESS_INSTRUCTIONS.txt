ðŸš€ HOW TO ACCESS YOUR LTOC PLATFORM
===================================

The server is running! To access it from Windows:

OPTION 1 - Direct Windows Access (Easiest):
------------------------------------------
1. Open Windows Command Prompt (Win+R, type "cmd", press Enter)
2. Navigate to your project:
   cd C:\Users\julia\DEV\LTOC\scripts\functional-platform
3. Run the server:
   npm run dev
4. Open browser to: http://localhost:3000

OPTION 2 - WSL2 Localhost Forwarding:
-------------------------------------
WSL2 should automatically forward localhost. Try these URLs:
- http://localhost:3000
- http://127.0.0.1:3000

OPTION 3 - Manual Port Forwarding:
----------------------------------
1. Find your WSL IP:
   In WSL terminal: hostname -I
2. In Windows PowerShell (Admin):
   netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=3000 connectaddress=[YOUR_WSL_IP]
3. Open: http://localhost:3000

CURRENT STATUS:
--------------
âœ… Platform is fully built with:
   - User profiles with avatars
   - Theory creation with markdown editor
   - Dashboard with stats
   - Working navigation
   - All buttons functional

If none of these work, the Windows Firewall might be blocking the connection.
Try temporarily disabling it to test.
